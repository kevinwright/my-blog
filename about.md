## About 

I craft software.  Mostly in Scala, but sometimes in Javascript with angular.js and maybe d3; very rarely in Java.  PHP is right out.

Current areas of interest are:

* Reactive programming
* Scala compiler plugins
* Scala macros
* Home automation

To date, notable products that I've contributed to include:

* The core Scala library
* Lift
* Play
* Akka
* Spray
* Shapeless
* Kafka
* Syslinux
* _and others... this list is not comprehensive_
